# autoKeyPresser
Just a little auto key presser I made does not work with spacebar or enter most other keys should however.

Used GlobalKeyboardHook.cs from https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19004/A-Simple-C-Global-Low-Level-Keyboard-Hook
for button press to be used when program is used in the background.
